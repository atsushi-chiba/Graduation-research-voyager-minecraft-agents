# a night sample counts the whole colony as idle: a false positive. gameTime
# (already in /status) mod 24000 is the Minecraft time-of-day; workers wake near
# dawn (0) and go to bed at dusk (~12000). We sample only inside a window that is
# solidly daytime, avoiding the dawn wake / dusk commute transitions too. Genuine
# problems (unseeded farm, material-starved crafter) are idle ALL day, so they
# still land in this window; only night sleep is excluded.
